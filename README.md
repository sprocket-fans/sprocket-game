# sprockets-game
This is a fan site tracking the progress of Sprockets, the tank design game.

**Hamish Dunn** has a lot of work cut out and we would like to help him track some of the ongoing discussions about the game. If you have helpful information to add to the wiki, feel free to do so (under the _Wiki_ tab). Send a github message to **sprockets-fans** if you would like to help maintain this site.

Report and track issues under the _Issues_ tab.

If your issue is more like a feature request, it will stay open to be discussed for a while, then we will close it if the developer hasn't announced it in the plans.
