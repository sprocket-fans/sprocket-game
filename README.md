# About Us
This is a fan site tracking the progress of Sprocket, the tank design game.

**Hamish Dunn** has a lot of work cut out and we would like to help him track some of the ongoing discussions about the game. Send a github message to **sprockets-fans** if you would like to help maintain this site.

# How To
If you have helpful information about the game to add to the wiki, feel free to do so (under the _Wiki_ tab). 

Report and track issues under the _Issues_ tab.

If your issue is more like a feature request, it will stay open to be discussed for a while, then we will close it if the developer hasn't announced it in the plans.
